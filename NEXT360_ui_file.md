# NEXT360 ORGANIC MARKETPLACE – FINAL UI/UX DESIGN BRIEF

## 1. Project Overview
NEXT360 Organic is a web-first multi-vendor eCommerce platform for organic and eco-friendly products. The design must feel fresh, trustworthy, and comfortable — inspired by “mother nature.” Focus on mobile browsers first, then extend to a dedicated mobile app.

**Core Goal:** Clean, minimal, nature-inspired UI that scales across devices without flashy tones.

- Light, organic, and professional aesthetic.
- Fully responsive, mobile-first design.
